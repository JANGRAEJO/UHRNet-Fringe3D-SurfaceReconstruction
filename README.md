# 🌊 UHRNet for Fringe Pattern to Height Map Conversion

UHRNet for Fringe Pattern to Height Map Conversion

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation and full training/inference pipeline for converting **structured-light fringe pattern images** into **surface height maps** using a deep learning model based on the UHRNet architecture.

Fringe pattern images—generated through **structured light projection techniques**—encode 3D surface geometry by projecting sinusoidal patterns onto an object. As the pattern deforms over the object's shape, it carries depth-related information that can be interpreted to reconstruct a 3D profile.

This approach is particularly useful in **optical metrology** and **non-contact surface inspection**, where traditional methods such as phase unwrapping or multi-pattern acquisition can be complex or computationally expensive.

Our model provides a direct, end-to-end solution for **interpreting single fringe images** and reconstructing corresponding 3D height maps, enabling fast and scalable inspection pipelines in **precision manufacturing**, **semiconductor metrology**, and **optical surface analysis**.

## 📌 Project Summary

This project aims to train a deep neural network to interpret interference fringe patterns and output corresponding surface height maps, enabling **non-contact, high-resolution surface measurement** at micrometer-level precision. This is a crucial step for building practical tools in optics and precision manufacturing systems.

## 📁 Dataset

The original dataset used in this project is sourced from the supplementary materials of the paper:

- **Title**: [A deep-learning method for fringe pattern analysis with UHRNet](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.485239)
- **Authors**: Huang et al., Optics Express, 2023
- **Original GitHub**: [https://github.com/fead1/UHRNet](https://github.com/fead1/UHRNet)

The dataset includes:
- `f1_80.npy`: Single fringe pattern input
- `Z.npy`: Corresponding ground truth height map

> 📌 The original authors' pretrained model is not accessible outside China. Therefore, I trained the UHRNet model from scratch using their provided data.

## 🧠 Model & Training

### Architecture
- Model: UHRNet (modified version from the original GitHub)
- Framework: PyTorch
- Loss Function: MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- Training: Full training from scratch using **all available data** (not just 128 samples as used in the original example)

### My Improvements:
- ✅ Full-dataset training instead of partial
- ✅ Batched prediction and inference support
- ✅ Visualization code to compare:
  - Input Fringe Pattern
  - Ground Truth Height Map
  - Predicted Height Map
- ✅ Optional 3D surface plot generation using `matplotlib`

## 🎯 Purpose

This work serves as the foundation for an optical measurement system I'm developing that:
- Uses fringe patterns captured by lenses (e.g., Michelson Interferometer)
- Applies deep learning to **interpret optical data without complex phase-unwrapping or classical algorithms**
- Enables **precise surface flatness inspection** in real time

### 🗆 Understanding the Demo Output

The visualization below shows three side-by-side images for each sample:

| Input | Ground Truth | Prediction |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| !(output_vis/vis_00.png)|

- **Input Fringe Pattern**: The grayscale structured-light image captured from a projector-camera system. It contains subtle intensity changes based on the object’s surface shape.
- **Ground Truth Height Map**: The real 3D shape (height in mm or scaled units) of the object, used for supervision during training. This is usually obtained using an accurate 3D scanning method.
- **Predicted Height Map**: The output from our UHRNet model. It attempts to reconstruct the object’s depth based only on the single fringe image.

> Color maps: Red/Yellow = High surface, Blue = Low surface.

## 📊 Model Performance

The model was trained on the full [SIDO 3D Reconstruction Dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Single-input_dual-output_3D_shape_reconstruction/19709134).  
Unlike the original paper which used only 128 samples, this implementation utilizes the entire dataset for more robust generalization.

| Metric                  | Value         |
|------------------------|---------------|
| **Validation MSE**     | 13.1037       |
| **Validation SSIM**    | 0.8698        |
| **Test Input Resolution** | 640 × 352 |
| **Model Size**         | 30.33M params |

> 📌 The original paper reported a mean RMSE of 0.443mm and SSIM of 0.9978, but they used a smaller test set (only 128 images).  
> My results are on the full dataset, so direct comparison should consider this difference.


## 🔭 Future Work

- [ ] Integrate with real-time camera feed and depth prediction (MiDaS or self-trained stereo)
